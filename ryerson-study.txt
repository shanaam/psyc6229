Research Study on Attitudes Toward Statistics and Software

Dr. Counsell in the Department of Psychology at Ryerson is interested in examining
studentsâ€™ attitudes towards statistics and statistical software after a statistics course.
She has designed an online questionnaire that will take about 30 minutes of your time.
This is part 2 of the study, but you can participate even if you did not complete part 1
in January. For participating, you will be entered into a draw to win 1 of 2 $150 Amazon
gift cards. The survey is completely voluntary and confidential. In fact, your course
director will never know whether you participated or how you answered the survey
questions. More information about the study and researcher is included at:

The online survey is open until April 30, 2019.
